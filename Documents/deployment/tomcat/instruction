1. How do I make my web application be the Tomcat default application?

The pages and code of your "mywebapp" application currently reside in (CATALINA_BASE)/webapps/mywebapp/. In a standard Tomcat installation, you will notice that under the same directory (CATALINA_BASE)/webapps/, there is a directory called ROOT (the capitals are important, even under Windows). That is the residence of the current Tomcat default application, the one that is called right now when a user calls up "http://myhost.company.com[:port]". The trick is to put your application in its place.

First stop Tomcat.
Then before you replace the current default application, it may be a good idea to make a copy of it somewhere else.
Then delete everything under the ROOT directory, and move everything that was previously under the (CATALINA_BASE)/webapps/mywebapp/ directory, toward this (CATALINA_BASE)/webapps/ROOT directory. In other words, what was previously .../mywebapp/WEB-INF should now be .../ROOT/WEB-INF (and not .../ROOT/mywebapp/WEB-INF).

Just by doing this, you have already made you webapp into the Tomcat default webapp.

2. How to set the default port to 80 so that web application can access
   at http://localhost

Edit the <Connector> tag in server.xml. Change the port=8080 to port=80. Port 80 is the default HTTP port.
